# Insurance-Analytics

This project aims to analyze historical car insurance claim data to help AlphaCare Insurance Solutions optimize their marketing strategy and identify "low-risk" customers for potential premium reductions. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and advanced statistical modeling to derive actionable insights.

## Script Functionalities

**data_preprocessing.py:** Handles data cleaning, missing value imputation, and feature engineering to prepare data for analysis.

**ab_testing.py:** Conducts A/B hypothesis testing to evaluate the impact of features on your target variable, helping you decide which features to include in your models.

**modeling.py:** Implements statistical models (like linear regression) and machine learning models (like Random Forest and XGBoost) to identify relationships within your data.

**visualization.py:** Provides functions to create informative visualizations that aid in data exploration, model evaluation, and communication of insights.

## Commit Message Guidelines

To maintain a clear and well-organized repository, follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:

* **Imperative Mood:** Use verbs in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add preprocessing script" instead of "Added preprocessing script").
* **Concise and Descriptive:** Keep messages concise while providing enough detail to understand the change (e.g., "Fix missing value handling in data preprocessing").
* **Issue/Task References:** Include references to related issues or tasks (e.g., "Refactor feature engineering (#12)").
